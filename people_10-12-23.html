                        <p style="">Chunyu Wang, professor of Biological Sciences, and Chemistry and Chemical Biology at RPI, is an expert in NMR (nuclear magnetic
                                resonance) structural biology and in structural mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. He obtained his MD
                                in 1996 from Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). He was then trained in structural biology at Cornell University
                                under the guidance of Linda Nicholson, earning a PhD in Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2000. He carried out
                                postdoctoral work at Columbia University in Art Palmer’s group. After establishing his own research group at RPI
                                in 2005, he developed a strong research program in structural mechanisms in protein autoprocessing and Alzheimer’s
                                disease. Recently, his group is venturing into new and exciting areas such as drug discovery and biological sulfation. He has been awarded multiple grants from NIH and several grants for Alzheimer’s research, from Alzheimer’s
                                Association, Warren Alpert Foundation, New York State and American Health Assistance Foundation (Now BrightFocus foundation).</p>

                                    <p class="small">Nabin's expertise and research interest are in molecular biophysics of proteins involved in Alzheimer’s and cancer, as well as physical properties of lipid membranes and protein-lipid interactions. He has broad expertise in spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence, circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and solid-state NMR. Nabin received his BS in Physics (Physics, Chemistry, Math) from Tribhuvan University, Nepal in 2010. He moved to University of Texas, Brownsville, USA in 2012 where he got his MS in Physics (Biophysics). In 2014, Nabin joined University of Central Florida (USF), Orlando, USA and received his PhD in Physics in 2019. During his PhD, he worked on the structure-function relation of the membrane pore formed by amyloid beta peptide using spectroscopic techniques including solid state NMR. He then worked as a joint-postdoctoral researcher (2019-2020) between USF and University of California, Irvine to probe the self-assembly of Reflectin (Ref2Cx4) protein that comes from the light organs of cephalopods. In 2020, Nabin joined Dr. Wang's lab here in RPI to work on single molecule kinetic studies of the mechanism of gamma-secretase and familial Alzheimer's Disease. His projects also include biophysical characterizations of tau and p53.</p>

                                    <p class="small">James earned his BS in chemistry from Harvey Mudd College in 1995. He earned his PhD in
                                        chemistry from Penn State in 2001, where he studied solid-state NMR under Professor Karl T. Mueller.
                                        While at Penn State, he primarily worked on solid-state NMR method development and the application of
                                        solid-state NMR to glasses. James was a postdoc at the University of Washington from 2001 to 2005, where
                                        he had his first foray into biological sciences under the direction of Professors Patrick S. Stayton
                                        (bioengineering) and Gary P. Drobny (chemistry). While there, he studied the interactions and dynamics of
                                        the binding of salivary peptides to hydroxyapatite, the main mineral component of teeth using solid-state
                                        NMR. James ventured into solution-state NMR of proteins under the direction of Professor James G. Kempf in
                                        the chemistry department at RPI in 2006 and 2007, primarily working to understand how different CPMG-type
                                        sequences worked together.  After that, he spent 10 years in industry performing solution-state NMR on
                                        silicone materials and their precursors. In 2018, James came back to RPI to work in Dr. Wang's research
                                        group. He studies the interactions of proteins and their binding partners with high resolution NMR spectroscopy.
                                        He is also responsible for adapting pulse sequences from other laboratories to our laboratory for use. </p>
