                    <p>Chunyu Wang, professor of Biological Sciences, and Chemistry and Chemical Biology at
                        RPI, is an expert in NMR (nuclear magnetic
                        resonance) structural biology and in structural mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. He
                        obtained his MD
                        in 1996 from Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). He was then trained in structural biology at
                        Cornell University
                        under the guidance of Linda Nicholson, earning a PhD in Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2000.
                        He carried out
                        postdoctoral work at Columbia University in Art Palmer’s group. After establishing his own
                        research group at RPI
                        in 2005, he developed a strong research program in structural mechanisms in protein
                        autoprocessing and Alzheimer’s
                        disease. Recently, his group is venturing into new and exciting areas such as drug discovery and
                        biological sulfation. He has been awarded multiple grants from NIH and several grants for
                        Alzheimer’s research, from Alzheimer’s
                        Association, Warren Alpert Foundation, New York State and American Health Assistance Foundation

                                    proteins involved in Alzheimer’s and cancer, as well as physical properties of lipid
                                    membranes and protein-lipid interactions. He has broad expertise in spectroscopic
                                    techniques such as fluorescence, circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared
                                    spectroscopy and solid-state NMR. Nabin received his BS in Physics (Physics,
                                    Chemistry, Math) from Tribhuvan University, Nepal in 2010. He moved to University of
                                    Texas, Brownsville, USA in 2012 where he got his MS in Physics (Biophysics). In
                                    2014, Nabin joined University of Central Florida (USF), Orlando, USA and received
                                    his PhD in Physics in 2019. During his PhD, he worked on the structure-function
                                    relation of the membrane pore formed by amyloid beta peptide using spectroscopic
                                    techniques including solid state NMR. He then worked as a joint-postdoctoral
                                    researcher (2019-2020) between USF and University of California, Irvine to probe the
                                    self-assembly of Reflectin (Ref2Cx4) protein that comes from the light organs of
                                    cephalopods. In 2020, Nabin joined Dr. Wang's lab here in RPI to work on single
                                    molecule kinetic studies of the mechanism of gamma-secretase and familial
                                    Alzheimer's Disease. His projects also include biophysical characterizations of tau

                                <p class="small">James earned his BS in chemistry from Harvey Mudd College in 1995. He
                                    earned his PhD in
                                    chemistry from Penn State in 2001, where he studied solid-state NMR under Professor
                                    Karl T. Mueller.
                                    While at Penn State, he primarily worked on solid-state NMR method development and
                                    the application of
                                    solid-state NMR to glasses. James was a postdoc at the University of Washington from
                                    2001 to 2005, where
                                    he had his first foray into biological sciences under the direction of Professors
                                    Patrick S. Stayton
                                    (bioengineering) and Gary P. Drobny (chemistry). While there, he studied the
                                    interactions and dynamics of
                                    the binding of salivary peptides to hydroxyapatite, the main mineral component of
                                    teeth using solid-state
                                    NMR. James ventured into solution-state NMR of proteins under the direction of
                                    Professor James G. Kempf in
                                    the chemistry department at RPI in 2006 and 2007, primarily working to understand
                                    how different CPMG-type
                                    sequences worked together. After that, he spent 10 years in industry performing
                                    solution-state NMR on
                                    silicone materials and their precursors. In 2018, James came back to RPI to work in
                                    Dr. Wang's research
                                    group. He studies the interactions of proteins and their binding partners with high
                                    resolution NMR spectroscopy.
                                    He is also responsible for adapting pulse sequences from other laboratories to our

                                    2017. Then she took a successive post graduate and doctoral program and joined
                                    Laboratory of Glycoscience and Glycotechnology (Advisor: Prof. Guangli Yu, Dean),
                                    Ocean University of China. During the graduate student period, she focused on the
                                    field of the interaction between carbohydrate and gut microbiota. She used in vitro
                                    anerobic fermentation system to investigate how human gut microbiota digest the
                                    polysaccharide into oligosaccharide. In addition, she also investigated the
                                    therapeutic effects of natural polysaccharide on colitis mouse through modulate the
                                    composition of gut microbiota. She earned her doctoral degree of medicine in 2023.
                                    She gained professional experience and skills with HPLC, LC-MS, colitis Mouse
                                    Models, culture of anaerobic bacteria and analysis of polysaccharide and
                                    oligosaccharide. In 2023, she joined Prof. Wang’s lab here in RPI out of interest in
                                    research related to NMR technology and Alzheimer's disease. Her focus is working on
                                    the protein-protein and protein-glycan interaction in Alzheimer’s disease and drug
